# Catheter Prediction AI ðŸ¤–

Catheters and tubes are inserted into the lungs to help patients breathe and/or deal with complications in lung surgeries. If they're improperly placed, they can cause throat injury, lung collapse, or even death. Furthermore, these tubes are connected with respirators and used to deal with COVID-19. 

However, diagnosing if a catheter is properly placed or not is a difficult tak. Experienced doctors must analyze X-rays, which often have multiple catheters in them, closely. Doctors can be inaccurate, and examining x-rays takes valuable time and resources from hospitals already strained by COVID-19.

Our solution is to use artificial intelligence to solve this problem. AI is much more accurate than a human and can give quick predictions at any time. Furthermore, it's more accessible to regions without fewer hospitals or other medical support. Our neural network model has over 98.5% accuracy on identifying key medical information about catheter placement in lungs, and was deployed to give predictions on user-uploaded images.
